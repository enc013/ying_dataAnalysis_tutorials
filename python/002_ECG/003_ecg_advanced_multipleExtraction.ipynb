Please see the 002_ecg_advanced_sectionExtraction Notebook for more information on the VRCCT experimental paradigm. You will also need to use its Helper Function __load_ecg__ as you will extract/preprocess the same sections from the datasets, but now we will have more than one subject to analyze. Given that, you need to finish the interactive exercises in that Jupyter Notebook.\n",

    "1. Extract/Preprocess __prebaseline and postbaseline (for both prestudy and poststudy)__ ECG with the load_ecg helper function and for loops.\n",
    "    - Save these dataframe outputs as CSVs in the csv folder in the data directory. Save them with a file name like __vrcct_p16_prestudy_prebaseline.csv__ or __vrcct_p16_poststudy_postbaseline.csv__; use the file_format variable. \n",
    "2. Extract/Preprocess __prestudy meditation ball__ data (in the same way you extracted it in 002_ecg_advanced_SectionExtraction) with the load_ecg helper function and for loops. \n",
    "    - Save these dataframe ouputs as CSVs in the csv folder in the data directory. Save them with a file name like __vrcct_p16_prestudy_ball.csv__; use the file_format variable. \n",
    "3. Extract/Preprocess __poststudy meditation ball__ data (in the same way you extracted it in 002_ecg_advanced_SectionExtraction) with the load_ecg helper function and for loops. \n",
    "    - Save these dataframe ouputs as CSVs in the csv folder in the data directory. Save them with a file name like __vrcct_p16_poststudy_ball.csv__; use the file_format variable. \n",
    "4. Extract/Preprocess __poststudy compassion tree__ data (in the same way you extracted it in 002_ecg_advanced_SectionExtraction) with the load_ecg helper function and for loops. __Remember that you need to load in the PostStudy_TreeEvents spreadsheet as each subject spent different times in this experimental section!__\n",
